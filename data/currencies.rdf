    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The rial is the currency of Iran . The name derives from the Spanish Real, which was for several centuries, the currency in Spain (derived from Spanish rey = king). Although the &quot;toman&quot; is no longer an official unit of Iranian currency, Iranians commonly express amounts of money and prices of goods in &quot;tomans. &quot; For this purpose, one &quot;toman&quot; equals 10 rials. Despite this usage, amounts of money and prices of goods are virtually always written in rials.</rdfs:comment>
